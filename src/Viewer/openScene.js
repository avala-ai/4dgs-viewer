/**
 * Opening a `.4dgs` and asking it for the gaussians alive at an instant.

 * Everything here is `@4dgs/core` driving; there is no second parser on this page. The
 * only job of this module is to give the renderer one shape — a {@link Frame} — whichever
 * of the format's three read paths produced it:
 *
 * - **indexed** (`gaussian-birth`, file carries a Chunk Index): the Footer, then the
 *   index, then only the byte ranges whose `[t0, t1)` contains the instant on screen.
 *   This is the seek path the format exists for, and it is the default.
 * - **streamed** (`gaussian-birth`, no usable index): `decodeScene` walks the resource
 *   front to back in bounded reads. Also the fallback for a truncated file, whose Footer
 *   never arrived.
 * - **keyframe-delta**: composition, then reconstruction at the instant.
 *
 * All three take an `IReadable`, so a local `File` (`BlobReadable`) and a pasted URL
 * (`HttpRangeReadable`) are the same code from here down.

 * reading only the chunks that cover the instant, but `decodeScene` concatenates every

 * recover the mapping or admit it cannot. It can be recovered exactly when the file carries
 * a Chunk Index: `assembleGaussians` lays chunks out in the order it visited them, which is
 * file order, and each index entry says how many gaussians its chunk holds.
 *
 * A Chunk Index reached this way has been vouched for by nothing. This path runs precisely
 * when the Footer did not open, so no summary CRC covered the index, and a per-entry
 * `gaussian_count` that is wrong in a way the total hides — two entries with their counts
 * swapped — would assign decoded rows to the wrong intervals and draw a plausible, wrong
 * scene. So every entry is checked against the Chunk record it names, exactly as
 * `IndexedDecoder.readChunk` checks it before decoding: the record at `chunk_offset` must
 * be a Chunk, and its header's `count`, `t0` and `t1` must be the ones the entry claims.
 * That costs one fixed-size framing read and then the record's own validated range, on a
 * path already reading the file front to back, and it is the difference between a gate and
 * a guess.
 *
 * A gate is not built unless every one of those checks passes. Nothing here refuses the
 * file: the gaussians decoded, and the indexed reader — the one whose contract an index
 * is — was already unusable on this file. An index that disagrees with its own chunks
 * simply does not get to decide what is visible, and the returned `why` says which record
